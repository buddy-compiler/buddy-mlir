## Difference and Performance Comparison

We proposed a coefficients broadcasting algorithm with strip mining strategy (CB-SM) to accelerate 2D convolutions, 
which is the key operation in deep learning, image/video processing, and computer vision.

The differences compared with state-of-the-art approaches are as follows:

- OpenCV

OpenCV uses the DFT-based algorithm for the filter2D function.
Unlike our method using FMA, the DFT-based algorithm only needs multiplication, 
but the cost is to perform a forward or inverse DFT.

- DL frameworks

TensorFlow and PyTorch compute Conv2D operation with GEMM. 
Thus, input and output transformation are necessary, which causes additional overhead. 
Our approach vectorizes the convolution directly without any transformation.
